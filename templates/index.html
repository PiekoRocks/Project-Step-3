<span class="token spacer"></span>
<span class="token p1">Our StreamLine application is designed to manage data for over 5,000 fire hydrants across urban, </span>
<span class="token p1">suburban, and rural areas. Fire hydrants require regular maintenance, including inspections and repairs </span>
<span class="token p1">performed by field workers. To ensure operational efficiency and make it easier to keep hydrants working </span>
<span class="token p1">for emergencies, the status of these hydrants must be tracked, allowing field workers to prioritize </span>
<span class="token p1">their tasks effectively.</span> 
<span class="token spacer"></span>
<span class="token p2">StreamLine will serve as a centralized hub for hydrant data, consolidating key details such as unique </span>
<span class="token p2">IDs, locations, and hydrant types. The problem with current databases is that most information about </span>
<span class="token p2">hydrants is stored in multiple systems (spreadsheets, handwritten logs, legacy software). This makes it </span>
<span class="token p2">challenging to access reliable and comprehensive hydrant information when needed.</span>
<span class="token spacer"></span>
<span class="token p3">The solution is to create a centralized fire hydrant database powered by StreamLine. This platform will </span>
<span class="token p3">automate manual tasks such as scheduling maintenance and inspections, reducing human error and </span>
<span class="token p3">increasing efficiency. Hydrants can be tracked in real-time, with a map-based interface providing </span>
<span class="token p3">up-to-date locations and operational statuses.</span>
